      <p>
        I have over 10 years of experience as a software engineer, shaping my
        skills at Google for 7 years. I have since then worked mainly at
        startups as well as helping small businesses grow online.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an expert in mobile development on iOS and Android, as well as web
        development for mobile and desktop. I am also skilled in backend
        application development, I've even gotten comfortable with Dev Ops in
        the last few years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Practical uses of Machine Learning is another one of my areas of
        expertise, having developed a variety of efficient and useful Machine
        Learning applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not afraid of learning new things, and I'm always looking for new
        challenges.
