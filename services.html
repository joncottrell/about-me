    <h3>App Development</h3>
    <div class="paragraphs">
      <p>
        If you're sitting on an app idea or two, or if you have an app that
        could use some improvement, reach out to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in polish and speeding up development. I can take your app
        to the next level. With my help, your app will be polished and ready for
        prime time sooner than you'd expect.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Google can trust me with YouTube and Gmail. And the Peloton investors
        can trust me with their newest app, you should too!

    <h3>Photography and Retouching</h3>
    <div class="paragraphs">
      <p>
        If the subject is people, I'm your guy. I've successfully wrangled all
        kinds of subjects ranging from supermodels beloved by the great Patrick
        Demarchelier, or your great aunt who has the snaggle tooth and hates to
        be photographed.
      </p>
      <p>
        My retouching tends to be subtle, and keeps the focus on the subject,
        rather than on the retouching.

    <h3>Modeling and Dancing</h3>
    <div class="paragraphs">
      <p>
        I've modeled for major retailers, mom and pop shops, and for amazing
        fine arts photographers such as Arthur Tres and Jeffrey Braverman.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was a professional dancer, prominently features on stages in
        New York City, San Francisco, and Montreal..

      <p>
        I've helped numerous small businesses beef up their online presence. I
        have particularly specialized in Restaurants, Bars, and Entertainment

        I don't just help you optimize your site bringing down the cost of your
